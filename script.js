//create stepStatus; everything is stepStatus 1 until an operator sign is hit, then it switches to 2. 
//once the equals sign is hit, it clears array 1 and puts the solution in;
//if an operator is hit && array1 is empty, then array1 will have the current solution put in;
//array2 stays the same until an operator is hit, then it is cleared and waits for status2
